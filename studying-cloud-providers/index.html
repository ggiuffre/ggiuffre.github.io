        <h1>The Enthusiastic Historian's Approach to Terraform and Cloud Providers</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <article>
            <p>Learning how to use a specific cloud provider can feel a bit pointless. Why should you read documentation
                and tutorials about AWS if in two years from now you might be using Azure or Alibaba Cloud?</p>
            <p>In general many software engineers feel this &quot;pointlessness&quot; when reading the documentation of
                a new tool. We enjoy solving interesting architectural problems more than reading the docs of a specific
                technology.
            </p>
            <p>If you feel like this about Terraform, about existing config files written by someone else, or about AWS
                and its myriad of services, then embrace the Enthusiastic Historian's approach to Terraform and cloud
                providers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>know your geography</li>
                <li>study the history behind it</li>
                <li>learn the standard language, no matter how mystical</li>
                <li>research about etymology</li>
                <li>embrace a theory before refuting it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Infrastructure Geography</h2>
            <p>The infrastructure that your company is running on AWS os some other provider is not a dull network of
                machines. It's an enchanted land with its own very peculiar geography! Learn its geography to better
                visualize its concepts in your head.</p>
            <p>By the way, when I say &quot;cloud infrastructure&quot; I mean the network of servers, databases,
                gateways and
                other components that your company is leasing from a cloud provider like AWS or Azure in order to run
                its business.</p>
            <p>Back to geography:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Internet is the world.</li>
                <li>A VPC is a city surrounded by (fire)walls.</li>
                <li>An EC2 instance is just a building. It can have many purposes: it can be an archive, it can be an
                    office, or it can be a gate in the walls and even a well-guarded bastion!</li>
                <li>An ECS cluster is a company with offices in many buildings.</li>
                <li>Subnets are groupings of buildings that share the same access rule, either public or private
                    access&mdash;more on this later.</li>
                <li>NAT gateways are the entrance of private subnets.</li>
                <li>An Internet gateway is the main gate of your city.</li>
                <li>Routing is the infrastructure that connects buildings, i.e. roads and street signs.</li>
                <li>Load balancers are policemen warding the traffic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's start with a bird's eye view. The <strong>Internet</strong> is the world, and a magical one as we
                will see. It's made of many <strong>VPCs</strong>, which you can think of as cities, each ruled by a
                wise king. In fact when you create an AWS account you're assigned a VPC, thus becoming the king of a
                small empty city.</p>
            <p>An <strong>EC2 instance</strong> is just a building. It can have many purposes: it can be an archive, it
                can be an office, it can be a NAT gateway or many other useful things. With that in mind, you can see
                an <strong>ECS cluster</strong> as a company that has offices in several buildings across the city. Each
                EC2 building might host several offices, each one computing whatever its ECS company/cluster wants to.
            </p>
            <p>A <strong>subnet</strong> is a grouping of buildings that share the same access rule: either they're
                normal buildings with a public address or they're buildings inside a privately-owned area like a
                university campus, a company or a tennis club. With this image in mind, read the following sentence from
                the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/how-it-works.html">AWS documentation</a>:
                <em>A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC</em>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>NAT gateways</strong> and <strong>Internet gateways</strong> are doors, gates: a NAT gateway gets
                you in and out of a subnet; an Internet gateway, on the other hand, gets you in and out of the city. The
                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html">AWS documentation</a>
                defines an Internet gateway as <em>A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between
                    resources in your VPC and the internet</em>. The Internet gateway of a city is cool with anybody
                entering and exiting the city, both locals and foreigners, as long as they respect the rules. NAT
                gateways, on the other hand, are stricter: they can only be used by residents of their subnet.
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of gateways is related to (but different than) <strong>routing</strong>: while routing is the
                infrastructure that connects buildings (roads and street signs), gateways are more like an address that
                is advertised inside your subnet or VPC as the place to go if you want to get to a different subnet or
                to the Internet. For example the NAT gateway of a private subnet is the only way residents of that
                subnet can get out to the city (and back inside the subnet). The Internet gateway is the only way that
                both locals and foreigners have to go in and out of the city.</p>
            <p><strong>Load balancers</strong> are policemen warding the traffic&mdash;especially useful during rush
                hour.</p>
            <p>And so on. Build more of these geographic analogies in your head, and you will rule the cloud like a wise
                king.</p>
            <h3>The real world</h3>
            <p>your VPC/city must live inside a &quot;region&quot;, a real-world location where AWS has clustered some
                data centers. These data centers are the connection between the real world and the imaginary enchanted
                world that we're exploring. Every data center is connected to the AWS private global network, which is
                in turn connected to multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Your users too are connected to an ISP,
                through which they can connect to a data center where your VPC is hosted.</p>

            <h2>History Studies</h2>
            <p>Aside from geography, history can be insightful too.</p>
            <p>I find it useful to start from the beginning: why do we even need such a network of machines?</p>
            <p>A pragmatic way to answer this question is to think business: do we need to store data? train statistical
                models? serve browser requests? send notifications via e-mail/SMS? authenticate users? Find out why it
                would make sense to delegate such tasks to a cloud provider.</p>
            <p>In my case, for example, my company's business is a tele-medicine service offered through a web app and a
                mobile app. These apps have a back-end that should be able to persist data and send notifications
                regularly or upon some event. We're using AWS. When I arrived, there were already existing Terraform
                files and I wondered where to start reading. So I asked myself those pragmatic business questions from
                above (wo we need to store data? send notifications? etcetera) and from those questions everything
                unfolded, for example: yes, we need to store data. So there's got to be somewhere in the AWS console
                (and in the Terraform files) a database. With a bit of searching you get to the right files, give a look
                at the docs for the <code>aws_db_instance</code> resource type, and then start all over again with
                another business question: do we need to send notifications? And so on.</p>
            <p>Besides finding the resources that answer your business questions, can you also see how they reference
                each other? What do those references express?</p>
            <p>So you can understand a good deal of an existing cloud infratructure by just asking questions.</p>
            <p>And these questions don't need to be exclusively about your company's business. They can also be
                questions about why a cloud service has a certain name.</p>
            <p>For example <strong>elastic IP addresses</strong> might sound like some &quot;marketing name&quot; for
                regular static IPs. They're not. Asking the question of why they have such name will give you an idea of
                the interesting problems that AWS engineers had to solve. In the case of elastic IPs, here's the deal:
                they solve a problem that cannot be solved by only offering static IPs and dynamic IPs. Only offering
                static IPs might lead to people buying a ton of IPs in block &quot;just in case&quot;, and then not
                using them. On the other hand, only offering dynamic IPs makes it harder for machines to talk to each
                other. &quot;Elastic IPs&quot; solve this problem: they are static IPs that are free if used, and not
                free if unused. This encourages developers to only reserve IPs that they use, and to release unused ones
                back to the AWS pool of available elastic IPs.</p>

            <h2>Reading Terraform</h2>
            <p>Terraform is just one technology among many, and again you might feel the same kind of discomfort that
                you felt when trying to grasp the giganticness of AWS services: why should I learn Terraform if some
                other technology will be around in a few years?</p>
            <p>Here again it's helpful to look at this with the eyes of a historian, or perhaps a student of liguistics.
            </p>
            <p>You have right now the privilege of diving into a simple, almost &quot;primitive&quot; language a bit
                like C was when people were still figuring out how to create a good programming language. In hindsight C
                is an old, low-level language that requires you to know hardcore stuff like how to use registers and how
                to allocate memory&mdash;in a certain sense it's a primitive version of Python or Java, which do all of
                this for you.
            </p>
            <p>Wouldn't it have been thrilling to live in those Jurassic days when C was young? Maybe you've even lived
                those days, if you're old enough. In any case, think about Terraform in this way. You have the
                opportunity to learn a language that gives you quite a deep, low-level view on how a private network of
                machines is built.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Terraform has a beautiful quality: it's simple. Terraform, or rather HCL (Hascicorp
                Configuration Language) is a simple syntax to declare an unordered set of resources. You can read HCL
                code as a graph of resource that depend on each other. In fact this is what Terraform does: it reads the
                current state of your application, reads the configuration files that you wrote (i.e. the desired state
                of your application), builds a graph where resources are nodes and edges are dependencies, and then
                transforms your graph into another graph that can be efficiently traversed to resolve the differences
                between your config and the current state of your application.</p>

            <h2>Icons Etymology</h2>
            <p>The next &quot;technique&quot; to grokk the cloud is Icons Etymology, or how to read AWS icons (or the
                icons of cloud services in general, not just in AWS).</p>
            <p>When exploring a new field, some etymology can get you a long way: studying Latin and Ancient Greek in
                school helped me with maths and philosophy.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the field of cloud computing is young but its main words stem from &quot;old&quot; concepts
                like databases, route tables, CPUs and lambda functions: an AWS RDS instance is just a (managed)
                database; an AWS EC2 instance is basically a machine with a CPU and other regular things like memory and
                peripherals; lambda functions in AWS are a way for you to run computations that don't require persistent
                state, similarly to functions in lambda calculus.</p>
            <p>So each cloud service usually has an icon that represents the &quot;old concept&quot; that this service
                &quot;wraps&quot;.</p>
            <p>The icon of AWS RDS is the classic three-disk tower that universally represents databases. Back in the
                day when non-volatile memory was on magnetic disks, databases were just software reading from and
                writing to a bunch of hard disks (more than 1 disk, for redundancy... think RAID). Technology changes
                and SSDs are now the standard, but etymology stays: three disks represent a database.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the symbol for AWS EC2 is a CPU because EC2 is a service that helps with computing.</p>
            <p>Most other icons for cloud services and resources can be traced back to old concepts. Here are examples
                from AWS icons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Internet gateways are open doors;</li>
                <li>routers remind of the lines coming from different networks;</li>
                <li>the AWS icon for a route table resource shows some IP addresses;</li>
                <li>AWS Route 53 (a service dedicated to routing) has an icon with the same shape of the famous US route
                    signs;</li>
                <li>S3, the Simple Storage Service of AWS, is clearly symbolized with the simplest thing you can use to
                    hold a heterogeneous collection of objects: a bucket.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And so on.</p>
            <p>In general, it's useful to pay attention to these icons and make sure they make sense to you.</p>

            <h2>DevOps Lessons from Bertrand Russell</h2>
            <p>The history of philosophy is a history of wrong ideas. So is science: a chain of theories where one
                theory corrects the previous one. And so is the history of technologies: C inspired C++, and JavaScript
                inspired TypeScript. Every technology improves on the technologies it's inspired from, and will be
                improve by the technologies it inspires.</p>
            <p>Terraform is just a technology, and one day it will be replaced by a better one. But understanding
                Terraform is worth it, as is worth understanding the theories of a scientist or the ideas of a
                philosopher, no matter how old or obsolete.</p>
            <p>Bertrand Russell says this clearly:</p>
            <figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind
                        of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his
                        theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as
                        possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held. Contempt
                        interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the second.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption>Bertrand Russell, <cite>History of Western Philosophy</cite>, 1945 George Allen & Unwin
                    Ltd. (chapter 4, &quot;Heraclitus&quot;)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>(And here's how it continues, in case you're interested to know more.)</p>
            <figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be
                        presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete
                        and final truth on any subject whatever. When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to
                        us obviously absurd, we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try
                        to understand how it ever came to seem true. This exercise of historical and psychological
                        imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many
                        of our own cherished prejudices will seem to an age which has a different temper of mind.</p>
                </blockquote>

            </figure>
            <p>That's the right mindset: learning yet another new technology is not a waste of time. It's a process that
                can give you powerful insights, and even examples of things you might encounter somewhere else.</p>
