    <h1>Searching for unbiased news in the 2020s</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <article>
      <p>A few years ago I realized that I wasn't keeping up with what's happening in the world. For this reason I
        decided to start reading the news more regularly.</p>
      <p>This choice raised a few questions for me, such as where to find reliable sources (newspapers, podcasts,
        blogs, magazines, etc.) and how to find unbiased news.</p>
      <p>This last question was especially interesting to me: <em>how to find unbiased news?</em></p>
      <p>I decided to read as many news sources as I could, with the intention of checking back after a couple of months
        to see what insights I had gained.</p>

      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>In a few months of reading I was able to find as many unbiased sources as perfect
        circles: zero. Some podcasters and journalists do a great job at reducing bias in the
        information they provide, but nobody ever gave me the impression to be perfectly unbiased.</p>
      <p>If there existed perfection there wouldn't be news, after all.</p>
      <p>However, from all this reading I got some valuable principles that are now helping me understand the
        world. The rest of this article presents these principles.</p>

      <h2>Look for biased sources</h2>
      <p>Journalism revolves around the basic difference between fatc and opinion. Journalists report
        <strong>facts</strong> and sometimes also give their <strong>opinion</strong> about these facts. Of each
        fact/event there is only one correct version but there can be many explanations, many opinions.
      </p>
      <p>Reading news in search of facts is usually not a problem: it can be as simple as reading the headlines of a
        couple newspapers, possibly from different political views. It is searching for good <em>explanations</em> that
        is more
        challenging.</p>
      <p>I found that it's worth looking precisely for <em>biased</em> sources and then comparing them with
        each other. This sounds paradoxical but it works. After having spent quite some time reading the BBC, The
        Economist, Axios, CNN, and La Repubblica, I started to read the English edition of newspapers like TASS from
        Russia and Global Times from China. TASS and Global Times are more censored than
        Western outlets like the BBC, but that's irrelevant in this context: they still give you an opinion. It's
        basically the opinion of the ruling party of their country.</p>
      <p>Identify your biased sources. For me now it's Reuters, TASS, SCMP, The Conversation, Global Times, BBC, Axios,
        Al Jazeera, The Week, Time, and The Economist. I personally see every source as biased. Once you've identified
        your sources, you can simply compare their opinion about the same fact. This is not just a fun exercise that
        will open your mind, but also a simple and easy way to tell fact from opinion.</p>
      <p>This brings us to the next point.</p>

      <h2>Labelling facts and opinions</h2>
      <p>If you still value finding news with as little bias as possible, then I suggest you look for
        sources that put some effort in clearly labelling what is opinion and what is data. I personally found that The
        Economist puts some effort into clearly labelling what is opinion, as well as even reporting alternative
        opinions without painting them in too bad a colour. They have their opinion and they make their mistakes, but
        among the sources that I tried they were the best.</p>
      <p>Until now I've mostly been reading (and listening to) free media, and The Economist was the only paid source
        that I read more than just a couple times.</p>
      <p>This brings me to say that paid sources can be of higher quality, and this also connects with another
        realization that changed the way I read the news.</p>

      <h2>Top-down vs. bottom-up censorship</h2>
      <p>Many Westerners find Chinese and Russian media to be more censored than the average Western newspaper. For this
        reason they end up reading Western media only.</p>
      <p>Western media has less control coming from the top than news outlets in China or Russia. But at the same time
        all media, especially in the West, are somewhat at risk of a different form of censorship, a sort of "bottom-up"
        censorship.</p>
      <p>As an example, take the war in Ukraine of 2022-2023: American outlets published a lot about it at the
        beginning, and then much less once the audience got "tired" of it.</p>
      <p>While with top-down censorship it's the ruling party that is in control of the media, with bottom-up censorship
        it's the audience that is somewhat involuntarily censoring the media.</p>
      <p>Censorship, in the end, is just repression of an opinion.</p>
      <p>This thought about top-down vs. bottom-up censorship is quite far-fetched, and I only put it here because I
        think it could be relevant in the future. But still, it helps read the news so I thought I'd write it down here.
      </p>

      <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, I approach all news as imperfect mirrors of the world. For each media outlet I try to understand
        what are its biases and with what kind of pressure/censorship it has to deal.</p>
      <p>I also try to read as many different sources as possible, no matter how biased/censored they might be.</p>
      <p>Finally, after some years of reading different sources I personally find Western, paid sources to be the least
        biased.
